                                   Graphql
                            ===================

===> Graphql is a query language for API's and server side run time for executing the queries.

===> it is also know as a syntax that describes how to ask for remote data.

===> it is originally designed to support clients requesting data from a sever.

===> it use a type system to define the data .

===> it is an alternative of REST architecture.

===> here we write queries an object type.

cons  of REST API:
==================
 
    ===> REST API requires multiple round tips to fetch related resources.

    ===> it often leads to under fetching (not giving everything one go) or over fetching (getting more that 
         what is need in one go).
     
    ===> as the application grows bigger the number of endpoints that are require can also increase and make 

         the code maintenance much harder.

Graphql:

    ===> query responses are decided by the client rather than the server. a Graphql query returns exactly

         what a client asks for and nothing more.

    ===> A Graphql query can be ensured to be valid with in a Graphql type system at development time allowing

         the server to make guarantees about the responses.
    
    ===> Graphql has single endpoint.

    FE and BE communication using Graphql:
==========================================

   ===> the web server build on nodejs and express frame work.

   ===> A request is made to the Graphql server by react application (built using apollo client library) or

        Graphql browser application.

    ===> the query will be parsed and validated against defined schema.
    
    ===> if the request schema passes the validation, then the associated resolver function will be executed.

    ===> the resolver will contain code to fetch the dat from anAPI or a database.

Graphql type system:
=====================

===> query means when you want to get the data. (GET)

===> mutation means : when you want update ,delete, add (put, post delete)

===> both the things are provide the Graphql schema.
